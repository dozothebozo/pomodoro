# Personal Pomodoro Timer Project

This will officially be my first project. Why a Pomodoro Timer? I found it to be a very interesting method for working and staying focused. I've seen it used everywhere and knew I needed to try it for myself. The problem is that every website I visited had a horrible UI and was too slow. Some even required a login â€” who wants to sign in? I'm pretty sure I could have found one among a million Pomodoro timer websites, but creating one myself seems much more reasonable. And so, here we are. Hopefully, by deploying this project for the first time and using it, I will gain the confidence to tackle other interesting and increasingly challenging projects.

# Requirements
- One-page, minimalistic application that fully occupies the viewport.
- Three session buttons:
  - **Pomodoro:** 50 minutes
  - **Short Break:** 10 minutes
  - **Long Break:** 30 minutes
- A timer centered on the page that shows the current session.
- A start/pause button that alternates with a reset button.
- An indicator displaying the current session (e.g., "Session 1 of 4").
- Each work session lasts 50 minutes, followed by a short break. After the fourth session, a long break.
- Session history that tracks and displays completed sessions.
- A settings icon in the top corner opens a modal to edit timer settings.
- A GitHub icon next to the settings icon directs users to the source code.
- Notifications when a session ends.
- Mobile responsiveness and keyboard navigation for all major functions.
- Dark/Light mode options - cus why not
